# Student Academic Performance Dataset

This repository contains the dataset and research paper for the Data Foundations for Machine Learning assignment.

## Contents
- `university_students.csv`: The dataset containing 100 samples of synthetic student data with 5 features and 1 label (GPA).
- `Assignment_Data_Foundations.pdf`: The accompanying research paper describing the dataset, its collection method, features, and intended use case.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a student's GPA (a **regression** problem) based on features like their age, major, weekly study hours, part-time job status, and commute distance.

## Usage
This dataset is ideal for practicing data preprocessing techniques such as:
- Handling categorical data (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Feature Scaling (Standardization/Normalization)
- Outlier detection and handling
